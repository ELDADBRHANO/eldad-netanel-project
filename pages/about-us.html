        <p class="fst-italic">
          Eldad brhano (13/5/1999 , israel), known as eldad hamelech, is etiopian-israeli pop, jazz, and
          soul keyboardist who played acoustic and Fender Rhodes. He is mainly known for founding and releasing
          albums on Black Jazz Records.

          Eldad was born in israel, Afula and was a cousin of guitarist Asmara Samuel. He studied with
          JAY Z. In the 1980s and 1990s, he composed music for film and television also appearing as an actor.
          Eldad played with ABAYNECH ASYA, LIOR DAWIT, SOLOMON AVRHAM, DANIEL MALDA, NETANEL TESPAY and
          BATEL HAYILO.
          Eldad also produced and engineered the label's initial releases, while maintaining complete artistic control
          through his production company, GR Productions.

          Eldad's vision for Black Jazz Records was for it to be geared towards the Black community, and all of the
          artists recording for the label were ethiopians israelis.The label was created as an alternative to
          traditional jazz, invoking a more political and spiritual tone, often with funk overtones.
